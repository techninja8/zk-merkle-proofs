# ZK-Merkle-Proofs

## Project Description

**ZK-Merkle-Proofs** is a Rust-based implementation of a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system utilizing Merkle Trees for efficient and privacy-preserving verification. The project demonstrates how to generate, prove, and verify Merkle proofs while ensuring that a verifier can authenticate a transaction without learning unnecessary details.  

The system follows a structured **Fiat-Shamir heuristic** approach for non-interactive proof generation, making it secure and suitable for blockchain applications, data authentication, and trustless verification mechanisms.  

## Features  

âœ… **Merkle Tree Construction** â€“ Efficiently computes the root hash from a set of transactions.  
âœ… **Merkle Proof Generation** â€“ Computes inclusion proofs for specific transactions.  
âœ… **Zero-Knowledge Proof System** â€“ Implements a challenge-response mechanism for trustless verification.  
âœ… **Attack Simulation** â€“ Demonstrates resilience against proof forgery attempts.  
âœ… **Rust Implementation** â€“ High-performance and memory-safe execution.  

## Installation & Usage  

### Prerequisites  
- Rust (latest stable version)  
- Cargo (Rust package manager)  

### Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zk-merkle-proofs.git
cd zk-merkle-proofs
```

### Build and Run  
```sh
cargo run
```

### Expected Output  
The program computes the **Merkle Root**, generates a **commitment**, and validates the proof using a **verifier function**. If the verification passes, it outputs:  
```
Merkle Root: <computed_hash>
ZKP Verification: true
```
If an attack is attempted, the system correctly rejects the fake proof.
